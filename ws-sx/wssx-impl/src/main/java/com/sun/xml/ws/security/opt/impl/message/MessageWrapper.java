     * <p>
     * To enable efficient copy operations, there's a few restrictions on

     *
     * <ol>
     *  <li>The original and the copy may not be
     *      used concurrently by two threads (this allows two {@link Message}s
     *      to share some internal resources, such as JAXB marshallers.)
     *      Note that it's OK for the original and the copy to be processed
     *      by two threads, as long as they are not concurrent.
     *
     *  <li>The copy has the same 'life scope'
     *      as the original (this allows shallower copy, such as
     *      JAXB beans wrapped in {@link JAXBMessage}.)
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>
     * A 'life scope' of a message created during a message processing
     * in a pipeline is until a pipeline processes the next message.
     * A message cannot be kept beyond its life scope.
     *
     * (This experimental design is to allow message objects to be reused
     * --- feedback appreciated.)
     *
     *
     *
     * <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
     * <p>
     * Since a {@link Message} body is read-once, sometimes
     * (such as when you do fail-over, or WS-RM) you need to
     * create an idential copy of a {@link Message}.
     *
     * <p>
     * The actual copy operation depends on the layout
     * of the data in memory, hence it's best to be done by
     * the {@link Message} implementation itself.
     *
     * <p>
     * The restrictions placed on the use of copied {@link Message} can be
     * relaxed if necessary, but it will make the copy method more expensive.
