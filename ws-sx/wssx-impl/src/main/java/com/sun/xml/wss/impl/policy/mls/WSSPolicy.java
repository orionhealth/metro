/**
 * Represents a base class for SOAP Message Security Policies.
 * Any WSSPolicy can be epxressed as being composed of one or both of
 * two SecurityPolicy components called FeatureBinding and KeyBinding.
 * This generic structure for a WSSPolicy allows for representing complex,
 * concrete WSS Policy Instances.
 *
 * For example, A SignaturePolicy can have a SAMLAssertion as its KeyBinding.
 * The SAMLAssertionBinding can in turn have a KeyBinding which is a PrivateKeyBinding.
 * The PrivateKeyBinding would contain a PrivateKey corresponding to the PublicKey
 * contained in the SAML Assertion of the SAMLAssertionBinding. Such a SignaturePolicy
 * instance can then be used by the XWS-Runtime to sign Message parts of an outgoing
 * SOAP Message. The MessageParts to be signed are inturn identified by the FeatureBinding
 * component of the SignaturePolicy.
