/**
 * The <code>Subject</code> element specifies one or more subjects. It contains either or
both of the following elements:<code>NameIdentifier</code>;
An identification of a subject by its name and security domain.
<code>SubjectConfirmation</code>;
Information that allows the subject to be authenticated.

If a <code>Subject</code> element contains more than one subject specification,
the issuer is asserting that the surrounding statement is true for
all of the subjects specified. For example, if both a
<code>NameIdentifier</code> and a <code>SubjectConfirmation</code> element are
present, the issuer is asserting that the statement is true of both subjects
being identified. A <Subject> element SHOULD NOT identify more than one
principal.
