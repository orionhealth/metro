                Enables or disables the flow control feature. When enabled, this
                feature works in conjunction with the Max Buffer Size setting to
                determine the maximum number of messages for sequence that can be
                stored at the endpoint awaiting delivery to the application. Messages
                may have to be withheld from the application if ordered delivery
                is required and some of their predecessors have not arrived.
                If the number of stored messages reaches the threshold specified
                in the Max Buffer Size setting, incoming messages belonging to the
                sequence are ignored.

                From MSDN:
                Flow control is a mechanism that reliable sessions implement to ensure
                that senders do not send more messages than a receiver can handle.
                Receivers have a buffer of messages that is used to accommodate
                message bursts and out-of-order messages. Receivers advertise to
                senders the amount of space remaining in this buffer in each of
                their acknowledgements. Senders can use this information to stop
                sending new messages whenever the receiver has no buffer space left.
