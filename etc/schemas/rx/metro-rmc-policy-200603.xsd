                By default, the call to proxy.close() will not return until all
                messages have been acknowledged. RM close timeout is the interval
                (in milliseconds) that the client runtime will block waiting for
                a call to close() to return. If there are still unacknowledged
                messages after this interval is reached, and the call to close has
                returned, an error will be logged about messages being lost.

                Specifies how long the RM Source will wait after transmitting a message
                and before retransmitting the message. If omitted, there is no implied
